# ⚽ Premier League Match Predictor — Story Mode 🏆  
**An AI-driven football prediction and storytelling system built in Python + Streamlit**

---

## 📖 Overview

This project predicts outcomes of **Premier League** matches using machine learning models trained on historical data.  
It then presents the predictions through an interactive **Streamlit web interface** enriched with visuals, team logos, head-to-head history, and a *Match Story Mode* that narrates classic rivalries and simulated match insights.

This system can:
- 📊 Train a model from historical Premier League data (past 25 years)
- 🧮 Predict upcoming fixtures (via CSV or UI)
- 🏟️ Provide interactive match insights and visualizations
- 🎨 Offer a creative *story mode* for any two selected teams
- 🎥 Link to classic match highlights on YouTube

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Model & Prediction Engine
- Uses **RandomForestClassifier** (scikit-learn)
- Trained on historical match data (`Date, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, HomeGoals, AwayGoals, Result`)
- Predicts probabilities for:
  - **Home Win**
  - **Draw**
  - **Away Win**

### 💻 Interactive Streamlit UI
- Team selection using clickable **team logos**
- Color-coded prediction cards using **official team colors**
- Shows **prediction probabilities** (e.g., 65% Home Win, 20% Draw, 15% Away Win)
- Displays recent and historical **match data**

### 🎬 Match Story Mode (Phase 5)
- Dynamically builds a **narrative** from head-to-head data
- Shows:
  - Total matches, average goals, win counts
  - Top 3 classic matches with context & YouTube highlight links
  - Interactive **goal timeline** (synthetic yet realistic)
  - Simulated top scorers (if player data unavailable)
- Designed to feel like a “football storytelling experience”

### 📦 Batch Prediction Mode
- Upload an `upcoming_fixtures.csv` file with columns:

- The system computes team stats and outputs:
- Automatically saves results to `data/predictions.csv`

### 🧩 Step-by-Step Usage

#### 🏋️‍♂️ Step 1: Train the Model

Run the model training script on your historical dataset:
python src/train_model.py


#### 🧮 Step 2: Predict Upcoming Fixtures

Prepare a CSV with upcoming matches:
Date,HomeTeam,AwayTeam
2025-11-15,Arsenal,Chelsea
2025-11-15,Liverpool,Man City

Run:    python src/predict_upcoming.py

Results will be saved to:   data/predictions.csv

#### 🖥️ Step 3: Launch the Web App (Story Mode)

Start the Streamlit interface:  streamlit run src/app.py
